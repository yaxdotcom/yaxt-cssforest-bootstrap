# CSS Forest: Bootstrap

This is a website built using the [yax.com](https://yax.com/) website builder project.

All pages are styled with the popular [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) CSS framework.

## Website pages

The website contains five pages:
- Home
- About
- Services
- Team
- Contact

## Using the on-page editor

You can edit content, headlines, images, and links on the pages using the [Mavo](https://mavo.io/) on-page editor. Use the link `https://example.com/index.html?login` to open the edit toolbar. Click "Edit" in the toolbar to begin editing. You can change the navigation links if you want to rename any pages. Leave the navlink text empty if you want to remove access to a page you don't use. To change an image (make sure the toolbar shows "Editing"), click on the image and change the image URL.
